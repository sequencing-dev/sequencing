`SeQuencing <https://github.com/sequencing-dev/sequencing>`_ is an open-source Python package
for simulating realistic quantum control sequences using
`QuTiP <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_, the Quantum Toolbox in Python.

Built for researchers and quantum engineers, ``sequencing`` provides an intuitive framework
for constructing models of quantum systems composed of many modes and generating complex time-dependent control Hamiltonians
for `simulations of quantum dynamics <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html>`_.
